          <b>Robert Garmhausen</b> - Software Engineer.
          I like to pick things apart and put them back together, experiment, and play.
          Node.js is my happy place.

          I've been a software engineer at <a href="https://www.dudesolutions.com/">Dude Solutions</a> for a few years.
          I've been working on an enterprise application with a whole bunch of users.
          Lately, my tech stack has been VueJS, .NET, and SQL Server.

          I'm a strong believer in open-source software and the amazing community it fosters.
          I hope to one day find a little more free time to help lower the barrier of entry into the programming world, to help spread code-literacy.

          When I'm not at my keyboard, you can find me playing board games and making music.
